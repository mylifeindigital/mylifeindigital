# My Life In Digital — Technical Growth Log

> A living record of my progression as an engineer, focused on mastering AI systems, backend architecture, and TypeScript at a professional level.  
> Not a portfolio. Not a tutorial. A deliberate journey.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Systematically strengthen my technical foundation  
- Capture learnings, mistakes, decisions, and breakthroughs  
- Build real systems, not theoretical side-quests  
- Create a traceable narrative of growth over time  

If you’re reading this: welcome to the engine room.

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

- Consistency beats intensity  
- Shipping beats perfection  
- Understanding beats copying  
- Systems over scripts  
- Calm, focused execution

## ✅ Daily Session Template

Each work session follows this structure:
- What I built today
- What I learned
- What confused me
- What I'll try next
- Quick self-assessment (1–5)

## 🧠 Philosophy

This repo is not about looking clever.  
It’s about becoming effective.

Progress will be real, visible, and occasionally messy.  
So will growth.

---

## 📍 Next Milestones

- [ x ] Complete TypeScript utility library skeleton  
- [ x ] Finalise backend scaffold structure
- [ ] Investigate AI orchestration using Hono JS
- [ ] Develop non-AI architecture. It should work without the AI bits first.
- [ ] Integrate AI Models into orchestration    
- [ ] Launch first AI-powered prototype
