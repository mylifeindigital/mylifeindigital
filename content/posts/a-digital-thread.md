# Threads of code. Threads of art. Threads of people.

A thread of wool. A thread in a piece of clothing material. A thread in software. A thread as a connector between people. We live our lives with threads woven between us. Each person we share experiences with can be seen as a thread.

How do I relate to the threads that run through my life?  

I started my digital journey in 2002 where I started as a data capturer. Back then I used Microsoft Access. In 2004 I moved to another organisation where I wrote my first piece of Intranet code using ASP.NET Web Matrix. What a blast that was - writing code to read data from, well you guessed it, Microsoft Access. Even though it was just an Intranet site it made me realise the one thing I really enjoy doing - seeing the code I write do something. Like magic almost. You get to change a variable here and there and see the change! 

It felt like a switch was triggered inside me. Something simple like having data pulled from a database to be rendered as HTML output. Not sure why it felt satisfying. Or to use the modulus operator the first time to render a list of items on a page in equal columns. You know - you retrieve 25 items from a database and you want to render it in a two column display? You would use the modulus operator when iterating over the collection of data. If the counter is divisible by two you would create a new block of elements from the next item after. 

It's not really about the code. I get excited about seeing the results - I'm not quite sure why it feels satisfying. It has been the one thread throughout my career that has kept me going. Its seeing something change. Its breaking a problem down into small chunks and solving it step-by-step. With each change you make to the code the closer you get to the desired result. It's a feeling I have never been able to conceptualize or describe. I still get it to this day. When running or debugging some code and seeing it work is magical.
