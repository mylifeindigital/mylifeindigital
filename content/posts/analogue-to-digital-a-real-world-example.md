In some cases a digital asset can have an analogue counterpart. At some point of a digital asset's existence a transition occurred. It went from one state to the next, i.e. analogue to digital. Something is considered a digital asset when you can use it on an electronic device such as a smartphone, laptop or PC. It can be as simple as a document scanned using a flatbed scanner. Many scanners convert the scanned item to PDF format.

I can relate the transition from analogue to digital as a lived experience. Back in the early to mid 2000s training managers at organizations still used VHS content in their workshops. 

For those who did not live through the Video Home System (VHS) experiences as I did it might not resonate. But I can tell you It was a different era. Not just in the world of corporate training but also for those who rented videos from video shops.  

It is a stark contrast with the experiences we have today where everything is online.

Looking back I realize VHS content was my first real experience of transitioning from analogue to a digital. I recall how I was part of a project to digitize a catalogue of VHS content. The catalogue covered topics in HR Soft skills. The target audience for the training material was aimed at training managers in the HR department. 

In the years before the digitization of VHS content training managers would come to an office to preview the material. They would sit with a VHS player and look at the content. In some cases the VHS content was shipped to customers on a "preview" basis.   

By digitizing the video content customers could preview the video content on-premise at the offices or online. Customers could still come to an office to preview training material. Instead of the VHS machine they would be provided with a PC. 

The digitization process was interesting. I remember using a piece of software called Pinnacle Studio with a breakout box to convert analogue VHS videos to a digital format. It was all legal - nothing was pirated. 

The breakout box had ports for audio and video - red/white for the audio and yellow for video. Digitizing a VHS video was straightforward. You would play the content using a VHS player connected to the breakout box. Pinnacle Studio would show the content being captured. You would run the VHS video for it's entire duration. Once complete you would stop the recording. The result would be an MPEG/AVI file. 

We went from analogue to digital. It represents the first real example of digitization. 

Users could watch the MPEG using a media player such as Microsoft's Media Player in the comfort of their desktop. You no longer needed the VHS player. 

VHS video had the one disadvantage of requiring a rewind. If you wanted to watch a video on a VHS player again you had to rewind the tape. With an MPEG file you simply used the scrubber in the media player to "rewind" it. You could share the media file (MPEG) with colleagues so they could watch it on their PCs. 

Even better you could convert the MPEG file to a streaming format such as WMV. You would use a piece of software such as Expression Encoder to encode the original MPEG file at various bit rates. Encoding the video at various bit rates enabled you to host the content on a Windows Server using Windows Media Services. When users connected to video content hosted on Windows Media Services it would adapt the stream to suit the user's Internet connection. If the user had a really slow connection the picture quality would degrade but they would still get to watch the video. Back in those days you would watch videos in the browser using an ActiveX control. It would render the basic Windows Media Player controls in the browser.   

The digitization process also coincided with my first Intranet application using ASP.NET WebMatrix. I created an Intranet application that let users connect to the digitized content. We used the Intranet application for training managers who wished to come to the office. The PC we provided them displayed the Intranet application. They could filter the catalogue on topics or programme style. When they found a title they were looking for they watched the video in the browser. 

Whenever I hear a word like digital I think about a VHS video being converted to a binary file format suitable for consumption on electronic devices.
