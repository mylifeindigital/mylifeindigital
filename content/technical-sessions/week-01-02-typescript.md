## Focus Area

Typescript memoization

---

## 🎯 Objective for Today
What I intended to work on in this session:
- Understand typescript function memoization
- Inspired by [Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/memoize/)

---

## 🛠 What I Actually Built / Did
Be specific. Real output only.
- created a basic script in experiments called snippets
- Added a npm build task to run the snippet
- Created a script that memoizes several calculations such as Fibonacci

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
New understanding, patterns, or insights:
- As in a previous session [general](./week-01-01-typescript-general.md) a function is initialized with an inner function
- The outer function declares constants only initialized when a call is made to the function
- The inner function then has access to the constant and because it returns a function it will have access to the constants declared in the body of the outer function.

## 😕 What Challenged or Confused Me
Things that slowed me down or felt unclear:
- I have to remember that scoping is an important concept

---

## 🔁 What I'd Do Differently
If I repeated today, I would:
- write several different implementations to solidify understanding

---

## ▶️ Next Session Plan
Concrete next steps (not vague ideas):
- Create basic little apps as standalone HTML to reinforce the learning

---

## ⚡ Energy & Focus Check
Rate from 1–5 and explain briefly:
Focus:  4 / 5  
Energy:  3 / 5  
Notes: I am building towards consistency

## 💬 Quick Reflection
One honest sentence:
- I do not have all the answers. But if I keep at it daily the results will come.
