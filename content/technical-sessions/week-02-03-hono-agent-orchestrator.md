## Focus Area

AI Agent Orchestration - setup with Hono JS

---

## 🎯 Objective for Today
What I intended to work on in this session:
- Understand the basics of an AI agent orchestration implementation

---

## 🛠 What I Actually Built / Did
Be specific. Real output only.
- Used Cursor AI to generate a PRD of an AI agent orchestration specifically using Hono and Cloudflare

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
New understanding, patterns, or insights:
- So here is my basic understanding so far:
  - Users (client apps) connect to the orchestration through a Hono API gateway
  - The API gateway validates requests using Zod (schema validation)
  - The API gateway also performs authentication and authorization
  - It applies rate limits per user/tenant
  - After validation, it hands off to the orchestration engine via a synchronous call to a Durable Object
  - The Durable Object initializes the workflow, queues agent tasks, and returns immediately
  - The client receives a workflow ID (202 Accepted) and streams/polls for results
  - Actual agent execution happens asynchronously — the client never blocks on LLM calls

## 😕 What Challenged or Confused Me
Things that slowed me down or felt unclear:
- Understanding the full architecture

## ▶️ Next Session Plan
Concrete next steps (not vague ideas):
- Continue working through the architecture to gain a clearer understanding

## ⚡ Energy & Focus Check
Rate from 1–5 and explain briefly:
Focus: 3 / 5  
Energy: 3 / 5  
Notes:
- A lot of it still feels unclear

## 💬 Quick Reflection
One honest sentence:
- I still have a lot of understanding to do
